# Bot Army Application
It is a React application that displays:
A list of available bots.
Name of the bots and their description.
It allows users to enlist bots into their army, view details about enlisted bots, and release bots from their army.

# Functionality
It has added event listeners to allow enlisting of bots, release of bots to the bots collection and deletion of bots.
It has routers to allow users to keep track of where they are currently on the webpage.
There is a db.json where we fetch data from and display bots.
* When you select any bot from the bot collection it copies the bot to the Your bot Army.
And when you release it disappears.

# Technologies
I have used React js framework library to output both front end and backend of my application.
I have used react-browser-react-dom to output the functionality of routing.
I have used css for styling my webpage.
